Hi, my name is Hosahalli Subramanya Krishna Chaitanya, yes believe me that is my full name.
You can call me HSKC.
I'm a software engineer and crazy music lover. 
I also play the guitar and love to drive.

Just another engineering graduate from 2014. 
I currently work at [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com).

The journey till here has been amazing. 
I remember back in school, I had little interest in programming. But over the past few years, it has really grown on me,
Now I love it!

I started off working on front end technologies like javascript, html and css, and in the past 2 years have worked with jQuery,Knockout and various other javascript libraries in the front, SQL at the back, and C# in between. Oh, and there is also node!

Music is something that has been close to me for a long time, but it became more closer when I started learning the guitar around 5 years ago. I use YouTube very actively, in search of something new to my ears! :D

I'm constantly exploring new things, and there is always an uncertainty as to what I'll be learning next.
Never stop surprising yourself, every day is a new day!

Cheers!
