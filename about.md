Hi, my name is Hosahalli Subramanya Krishna Chaitanya, yes believe me that is my full name.
You can call me HSKC.
I'm a software engineer and crazy music lover. 
I also play the guitar and love to drive.

Just another engineering graduate from 2014. 
I currently work at [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com).

The journey till here has been amazing. 
I remember back in school, I had little interest in programming. But over the past few years, it has really grown on me,
Now I love it!

I started off working on front end technologies like javascript, html and css, and in the past 2 years have worked with jQuery,Knockout and various other javascript libraries in the front, SQL at the back, and C# in between. Oh, and there is also node!

Music is my special friend. 
I started learning the guitar around 5 years ago, and that is when I totally fell into music.
I use YouTube very actively, in search of something new to listen to.

I'm constantly exploring new things, and there is always an uncertainty as to what I'll be learning next.
Never stop surprising myself, every day is a new day!

Cheers!
