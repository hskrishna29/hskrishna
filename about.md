Hi, my name is Hosahalli Subramanya Krishna Chaitanya, yes believe me that is my full name.

Music is my special friend. 
I also play the guitar, love driving, F1 and WWE.

An engineering graduate from 2014. 
I currently work at [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com).

The journey till now has been amazing. 
I remember back in school, I had little interest in programming. But over the past few years, it has really grown on me,
Now I love it!

I started off working on front end technologies like javascript, html and css, and in the past 2 years have worked with jQuery,Knockout and various other javascript libraries in the front, SQL at the back, and C# in between. Oh, and there is also node!

I'm constantly exploring new things, and there is always an uncertainty as to what I'll be learning next.

Cheers!
